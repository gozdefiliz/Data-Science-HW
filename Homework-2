Problem 1 (50 Points).
You are given a folder named “sales_per_day” which contains daily sales number of some items for about 30 days. 
Using this data find the most saled item for 30 day interval. Print the total sales number for this item. 
Your function should take the folder name as an input.

def problem1(folder):
    import pandas as pd
    import os
    #we list the filenames in the folder
    filenames=[f for f in os.listdir(folder) if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(folder,f))]
    #we change our path to folder
    os.chdir(folder)
    #we create an empty dataframe to fill with the text file in the folder
    data=pd.DataFrame()
    #In the for loop, we add every text file to our empty dataframe(data)
    for file in filenames:
        data_=pd.read_table(file,delimiter=':', header=0, names=['Item','Nb_of_Sales'])
        data=data.append(data_)
    #we group our data by the column 'Item' and sum the corresponding values
    data_grouped=data.groupby('Item').sum()
    #we find the maximum number in the grouped data
    most_saled_item=data_grouped[data_grouped['Nb_of_Sales']==data_grouped['Nb_of_Sales'].max()]
    #we find the name of the item, then we define the name and the number sales to variables
    most_saled_item_name=most_saled_item.index.values[0]
    nb_of_sales_most_saled=data.groupby('Item').get_group(most_saled_item_name)
    #we print the result
    print('Most saled item is {} which has the sales quantity of {}'.format(most_saled_item_name, nb_of_sales_most_saled['Nb_of_Sales'].sum()))

Problem 2 (50 Points).
Euro 2012 stats TEAM.csv file contains statistics of the teams that attended Europen Cup 2012. 
Using this data do the following tasks:
a) Find the teams that have lowest and highest number of yellow cards.
b) Find the team that has the best shooting accuracy.

def problem2(text):
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    #we import our data
    data=pd.read_table(text,delimiter=',')
    #we find the maximum number of yellow cards
    Max_Yellow_Cards=data[data['Yellow Cards']==data['Yellow Cards'].max()]
    #we find the team/teams with the maximum number of yellow cards
    Max_Yellow_Cards_Country=np.array(Max_Yellow_Cards['Team'])
    #we find the minimum number of yellow cards
    Min_Yellow_Cards=data[data['Yellow Cards']==data['Yellow Cards'].min()]
    #we find the team/teams with the minimum number of yellow cards
    Min_Yellow_Cards_Country=np.array(Min_Yellow_Cards['Team'])
    #we find the maximum of shooting accuracy
    Max_Shooting_Accuracy=data[data['Shooting Accuracy']==data['Shooting Accuracy'].max()]
    #we find the team/teams with the maximum of shooting accuracy
    Max_Shooting_Accuracy_Country=np.array(Max_Shooting_Accuracy['Team'])
    #we print the results
    print('countries that have the minimum number of yellow cards: \n{} \n{} \ncountries that have the maximum number of yellow cards: \n{} \nthe team that has the highest scooring accuracy is {}'.format(Min_Yellow_Cards_Country[0], Min_Yellow_Cards_Country[1], Max_Yellow_Cards_Country[0], Max_Shooting_Accuracy_Country[0]))
